computer science, cybersecurity. I am actively seeking an internship to further my career as a cybersecurity analyst. Currently employed at the Law
Offices of Mark W. Doran, P.L.L.C. as a law clerk, I bring experience in client
communication, legal document preparation, and extensive research. Eager to apply my
academic knowledge and practical expertise, I look forward to collaborating with a
diverse group of professionals in the pursuit of a successful cybersecurity career. <br>
