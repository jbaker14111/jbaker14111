### Hi! My name is Josiah Baker.

&emsp; I am currently a student at Liberty University Online, pursuing my Bachelor of Science in 
computer science, cybersecurity. I am actively seeking an internship to further my career as a cybersecurity analyst. Currently employed at the Law
Offices of Mark W. Doran, PLLC as a law clerk, I bring experience in client
communication, legal document preparation, and extensive research. Eager to apply my
academic knowledge and practical expertise, I look forward to collaborating with a
diverse group of professionals in the pursuit of a successful cybersecurity career. <br> 

&emsp; I am glad you are viewing my GitHub. Please look around. You will find my projects, papers, and certificates I have completed. These are frequently being updated, so please visit regularly!
